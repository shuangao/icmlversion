\begin{abstract}
Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has drawn great attention due to its performance in object recognition tasks. However, we are still not knowledgeable enough to fully understand its principle. Lots of works have been done to discuss the success of AlexNet while for the new born GoogLeNet, little work has done to analyze its architecture.  We design several transfer learning experiments on food recognition tasks for both AlexNet and GoogLeNet. By analyzing and comparing the results on both architectures, we try to reveal some of the reasons for the success of GoogLeNet. We also show that Deep CNN has strong generalization ability in transfer learning across two food datasets with little overlap categories even though the target set contains just a few labeled instances per category.
